when running the code, it will output a "best guess"

you then input the clue given by the Wordle site, where gray=1, yellow=2, and green=3

for example if the code suggested "vents" and the clue given for that guess was Yellow/Yellow/Yellow/Gray/Green you would input 22213

the program will then output the next best guess based on the new input givem
